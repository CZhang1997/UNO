UNO Card Game
This game needs four players to play. Each Player will take seven cards from the deck. 
After the four players receive seven cards from the deck, the game will take one more 
card from the deck as the beginning card. The goal to win this game is by using all of the 
cards that are in your hand. There are couple rules of the game. First, each player only can 
play one card per round. and the card that the player play has to be the same color or the 
same type of cards. The exceptions are the Wild cards and Wild Plus Four cards. If the 
player uses a Wild card, then he/she can choose the color he/she wants. The Draw Two 
cards will make the next player gain two cards. The Skip cards will skip the player that is 
followed by the user. lastly, the Reverse Card change the rotation of the player when they 
play. For example, the default rotation starts with Player A, then Player B, Player C, Player D, 
then go back to Player A. If Player C use the Reverse card, then the rotation will become 
Player B, Player A, Player D, Player C, then Player B again. This rotation will stay the same 
unless someone else uses the card Reverse. If you do not have the right card to play, then 
enter zero to gain a card. 
if you want to end the game, then enter -1. Have Fun playing UNO!!!"
